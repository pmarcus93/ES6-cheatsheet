/***** SCOPE *****/

// Block Scope
/* Creates a new 'child scope' inside the current one.
Works just like an IIFE. */

let a = 'External';

{
  let a = 'Internal';
  console.log(a); //Internal
}

console.log(a); //External


/***** DECLARATIONS *****/

// let Declarations
/* Because let declarations only initializes when they appear in the
scope block, it's a valid approach to declare them
on the first lines. */

{
  let a = 'a', b = 'b', c = 'c';
}


// const Declarations (Constants)
/* Constant declarations has to have an explicit initialization.
Constants doesn't restrict the value itself, only the assignment of it.
If the value is complex such as and array or object,
you can still modify them. */

{
  const name = 'Marcus', lastName = 'Pereira';
  name = 'Jo√£o'; // TypeError
}
